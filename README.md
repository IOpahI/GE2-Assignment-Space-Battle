Class Group: Game Design

# Description of the project

The idea for this project is to create a representation of an iconic sci-fi space battle scene from the movie The Last Starfighter.

# Events Summary
1. Camera sees the line of enemy ships behind the Gunstar
2. Camera pans towards the Gunstar
4. Gunstar flies around and then through the enmy shipsÂ´ linfe
5. Enemy ships starts chasing the Gunstar
6. Ships collide, explosions happen
7. The Gunstar stops moving and starts spinning, eliminating all enemy ships within its reach

# How it works
## Sequence
- The cameras are timed according to the waypoints the Gunstar uses to follow its path
- There is different cameras in the scene to show off the same angles shown in the original scene
- Gunstar follows a path, which at a certain point activates the enemy ships, which are autonomous agents, that will avoid obstacles and pursue the Gunstar
- Enemy ships will explode if they collide, as well as when the Gunstar starts spinning

## Behaviours
- ***Obstacle Avoidance***: Avoids game objects with a specific layer mask
- ***Constrain***: Keeps the Gunstar inside a set radius so it doesn't drift off
- ***Noise Wander***: Allows ships to wander within the worldspace
- ***Pursue***: Sets a target for the enemy ships to move towards

## Design
- Particle systems
  - Explosion plays when an enemy ship is destroyed. 

- Skybox uses space textures

Visual Aspects

- AI Flocking and pathfinding
- Switching cameras
